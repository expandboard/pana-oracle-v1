**Real-Time On Chain Price Feeds for Blockchain Applications**

The Darli Pana Price Feed is a Solidity implementation of an immutable Oracle Factory contract that allows anyone to deploy a new Oracle. Each Oracle contract allows Darli governance token holders to participate in price voting by staking tokens in a pool. The Oracle keeps track of staked tokens and allows Darli token holders to vote on a price, which can then be retrieved by other contracts.

## Features
* **Real-Time Price Updates:** Access accurate and up-to-date pricing data.
* **Blockchain Integration:** Easily integrate with popular blockchain platforms.
* **Decentralized Security:** Built with safety measures to prevent data tampering.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Supports high-traffic environments with low latency.
* **Customizable Sources:** Fetch data from multiple predefined or custom sources.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.x
- NPM >= 8.x
- Docker (optional, for deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darlilabs/pana-oracle-v1.git
   cd pana-oracle-v1
   npm install
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Test folder demonstrates a test for Oracle contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.
Try running some of the following tasks:

    ```shell
    npx hardhat test
    REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
    ```

4. Set up environment variables: Create a .env file based on .env.example and update it with your API keys and configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
